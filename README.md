install node 

then open terminal and install react (command = "npx create-react-app my-app")

after successfull installation, move into 'my-app' folder (command = "cd my-app")

rewrite the installed src files with this project file and make new file if it doesnt exists.

Now open react app output page (command = "npm start") or else  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Thank you !!
